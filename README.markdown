# Design Patterns in Ruby: Template Pattern

This is the template pattern from [*Design Patterns in Ruby*](http://www.designpatternsinruby.com/) by [Russ Olsen]


report1/ contains the first pass at the report script.
 
report2/ contains the second pass at the report script
        with enhancements to produce both HTML and 
        plin text output.

report3_template/ contains a first pass at using a template 
        design patern to accomplish the same goal as
        report2.

report4_hookmethods/ contains the final version of the template
        patten using hook methods in place of the abstract mehtods
	from report3_template.
